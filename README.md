This project is my Assignment 3, where I built a web page using React and TypeScript (TSX) by breaking the layout into reusable components for better maintainability and scalability. Each component was created in its own .tsx file and imported into the main page.tsx. I applied creative styling, including unique image borders and positioning techniques, to make the design visually appealing. The project is fully functional, and you can view the live version deployed on Vercel. The complete code is available on GitHub for reference. This project was a great opportunity to strengthen my skills in frontend development, modular design, and deployment."# assogment3"
